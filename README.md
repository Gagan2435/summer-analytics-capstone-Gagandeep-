üöÄ Summer Analytics Capstone: Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots
üìå Project Overview
This repository contains the Summer Analytics Capstone Project implementing demand-based dynamic pricing for urban parking lots using real-world data. The project uses occupancy, traffic conditions, queue length, special day indicators, and vehicle type to dynamically adjust parking prices, demonstrating practical use of data analytics for smart city management.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack Used
Python: pandas, matplotlib

üìù Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing:

Merge date and time into timestamps.

Map categorical features (traffic, vehicle type) to numerical values.

Sort dataset by time.

Demand Calculation:

Calculate demand based on occupancy, traffic factor, queue length, special day, vehicle type factor.

Dynamic Pricing:

Formula: Price = Base Price * (1 + Œª * Normalized Demand)

Base Price = ‚Çπ10, Œª = 0.5.

Visualization:

Plot generated using matplotlib to visualize price trends over time.

Report:

Documents methodology, results, and future scope for the project.
